# Infinite Scroll

## Objective

- The main objective of this project is to create a compelling and functional implementation of an infinite scroll animation. By building this project, I aim to achieve the following goals:
  - Improve my CSS skills by crafting an engaging user interface.
  - Utilize JavaScript to incorporate animations and enhance user experience.
  - Gain practical experience in web development by working on a real-world project.
  - Share my work with the community and contribute to the open-source ecosystem.

## Description

- I wanted to create a small project related to the commonly used infinite scroll animations on the internet, and I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLmBy-HKIAw) by Kevin Powell on YouTube.
- I started the project again to brush up on my CSS skills and to use animations with the help of JavaScript.
